# Transitioning Back to Ruby

Congratulations on completing the HTML and CSS introduction! You have now completed all the pre-CLI lessons. 

The CLI section will focus our attention back to Ruby, but it will also leverage our understanding of the HTML document structure and CSS selectors (ID, class, and type) during the ruby 'web scraping' lessons. 

You will also use your current HTML and CSS knowledge during the more advanced HTML and CSS lessons at the end of the CLI section.

Best of luck for the CLI section and congratulations for all the hard work.
